# Bayes' Billiards Balls

Imagine you are standing with your back to a billiards table. Your friend places a billiard ball somewhere on the table. You don't know where. They then place another ball on the table in a random location, and tell you whether that second ball is left or right and up or down from the first. Then they move the second ball to another location, and tell you its position relative to the first again. Given enough repetitions, can you determine the location of the original ball?

This program replicates this thought experiment from Bayesian Statistics, and helps visualize the approximation using a matplotlib surface graph.
